🚀 About Me
I am a dedicated Backend Developer with a passion for crafting robust, scalable, and modular microservices. My core strengths lie in:

Designing Serverless-First Architectures: Focused on optimizing cloud resource utilization and reducing idle costs.

Streamlining Deployment Processes: Enhancing efficiency and consistency in application delivery.

Integrating Cutting-Edge Technologies: Specializing in LLM (Large Language Model) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for advanced application capabilities.

Strong CS Fundamentals: Possessing a solid understanding of Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Database Management Systems (DBMS), Operating Systems (OS), and Computer Networking.

My professional journey is marked by developing critical microservices, orchestrating end-to-end CI/CD pipelines, and efficiently provisioning cloud resources through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
